**  So what is Delve?

=Delve= (currently version =0.9.4=) is a package on top of [[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam][Org Roam]]. It
provides tools to collect, inspect and edit Org Roam Nodes in a
separate application buffer. It helps you to quickly establish and
maintain a project-specific subset of Org Roam Nodes, e.g. when
writing a paper or for collecting information on a particular topic.
Those subsets (called 'collections') can be stored persistently in
separate files. =Delve= also offers functions to 'edit' nodes remotely,
e.g. by adding or removing tags without having to open the node's file
itself.

Here's a slightly outdated gif:

[[./screenshots/delve-intro-tour.gif]]

*Slightly Breaking Change*: As of v =0.9.4=, the [[#Storing collections in files][storage system]] has
changed. Previously, =Delve= storage files had only been accepted in a
special user directory relative to the Emacs root directory. The new
system accepts multiple storage directories. Since all storage files
will be recognized by their extension =.delve=, you must change all
existing storages by renaming the files. There is an interactive
function to automate that; see [[#Storing collections in
files][this section]].

* State of Development

The present version is a complete rewrite in response to =Org Roam=
fundamentally changing its internal structure when migrating from =v1=
to =v2=. It has grown much more than its author has expected. Please
file an issue if there are functionalities you miss or if you find an
error. Also feel free to discuss conceptual issues. 

Presently, development is mostly aiming at stabilizing the current
basic set of features and covering the present functionality with
automated tests. There are also plans for a closer integration with
[[https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui][org-roam-ui]]. Further plans are to add some export options.

* Feature List

 - =Dashboard= with customizable queries for quick access (and overview)
   of nodes with certain tags and of nodes with no links.
 - Sort any list with a spiffy interactive transient menu.
 - Insert or delete nodes interactively from the =Delve= buffer, or from
   any Org Roam file using =delve-minor-mode=.
 - Re-arrange nodes manually by moving them around, or by creating
   hierarchical trees.
 - Copy and paste Delve nodes individually, by marking them or simply
   using transient regions.
 - Yank copied Zettel into Org buffers as links.
 - Preview a node in =Delve= for a rough glance at the content of a node
   without having to leave the collection buffer.
 - Toggle between a short node view and a more extended one.
 - Edit the node's tags from within the =Delve= buffer without leaving it.
 - Insert backlinks or fromlinks of a specific node.
 - Hide away nodes by creating "piles".
 - Move marked nodes into a new collection.
 - Bookmark stored collections for quick access.

* Installation

=Delve= requires =lister=, which is available on Melpa. =Delve= itself,
however, is not (yet?) on Melpa. For the time being, you will have to
install it manually.

=Delve= is currently following the =org-roam= source without taking care
of the releases. If there is a DB error or something similar, consider
updating =org-roam= from source even if there is not a new official
release yet.

=Delve= profits from =all-the-icons=. If it is installed, items will be
displayed with nice icons. Install it from [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][there]].

Here's an example using =straight.el=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package delve
    :straight (:repo "publicimageltd/delve"
               :host github
               :type git)
    :after org-roam
    :bind
    ;; the main entry point, offering a list of all stored collections
    ;; and of all open Delve buffers:
    (("<f12>" . delve))
    :config
    ;; set meaningful tag names for the dashboard query
    (setq delve-dashboard-tags '("Tag1" "Tag2"))
    ;; optionally turn on compact view as default
    (add-hook #'delve-mode-hook #'delve-compact-view-mode)
   ;; turn on delve-minor-mode when org roam file is opened:
    (delve-global-minor-mode))
#+end_src

* The notion of a 'collection'

The core idea of Delve is to allow you to add stuff to "collections",
and to edit those. A collection is a list of nodes, either stored in a
file or currently visited in a =Delve= buffer. All commands which ask
you to do something "with a collection", e.g. to add a node to a
collection, first ask you to select the collection to act on. In these
cases, you can always choose both an open =Delve= buffer or a
storage file. Selecting a storage file effectively causes the file to
be read in a new buffer, reading it 'on the fly'.

*Example*: Imagine you have a stored collection of nodes referring to
the topic /Artificial Intelligence/. Then when visiting an Org Roam
file, you find an interesting node which you would like to add to that
collection. You press =M-n c= (=delve-minor-mode-collect=) and select the
file which contains that collection. Now a new =Delve= buffer has been
created in the background and the node at point been added to it. To
explicitly visit that buffer, use =C-u f12= (=C-u M-x delve=).

* Storing collections in files

If you call =Delve= (=M-x delve=), it will offer you a list of all stored
collections. This is useful e.g. when adding Org roam nodes to an
existing collection.

=Delve= tries to mimic Emacs's established behavior of storing buffers
into files. To store a collection, save any =Delve= buffer with =M-x
delve-save-buffer= (or =C-x s= from within a =Delve= buffer). To open a
collection (visit it in a new buffer), respectively use =M-x
delve-open-storage-file= (or =C-x f= from within a =Delve= buffer). To save
a buffer which is already linked to a new file, use =M-x
delve-write-buffer= (or =C-x w= from within a =Delve= buffer).

All storage files will be recognized by the file extension =.delve=. The
extension can be changed by setting =delve-storage-suffix=.

Once a buffer is associated with a file, the file name will be
displayed in the header. There will be an asterisk displayed before
the file name if the buffer content has been modified.

The default storage directory is defined in the variable
=delve-storage-paths=. It is initially set to a directory =delve-store=
within the local emacs user directory, which will be created when you
use the storage feature for the first time. But since it's Emacs, you
can customize it:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; one file name -- one directory:
(setq delve-storage-paths "~/path/to/directory")
;; a list of file names -- multiple locations:
(setq delve-storage-paths '("~/path1" "~/path2"))
#+end_src

Note that if you provide multiple paths, you will have to make sure by
yourself that these directories do actually exist.

All stored files can be /bookmarked/. Simply set a bookmark in the
visiting buffer. Calling the bookmark will jump to an existing buffer
containing that collection or load it.

*Changed at =0.9.4=:* If you had used =Delve= prior to v =0.9.4=,
you might want to convert all existing files in the storage directory
to the new file name format. You can use =M-x
delve-convert-storage-directory= for that. The function is interactive
and will guide you through the conversion process in two steps: It
first asks you for the directory name (the default should be fine if
you did not yet change =delve-storage-paths=) and then gives you some
information about the files found in this directory. Only after you
confirm that will your files be changed. In any case, the function is
just a bulk rename, so you can just do it manually.

* How items are presented

All nodes which refer to a file (and not to a subheading) look like that:

[[./screenshots/file-node-no-tags.png]]

Here the node has been created as a backlink from the node "Künstliche
Intelligenz (AI)". If you press RET on the button linking to that
original node, =Delve= will look for it and jump to it if it exists.

The other type of nodes (i.e., headings) looks like that:

[[./screenshots/heading-node-tags.png]]

Also note the list of tags which are associated with that specific node.

Per default, heading notes are displayed with their outline path,
including the file title. The variable =delve-display-path= controls
this behaviour, set it to =nil= to turn this off. Here's two nodes first
with path and then without:

[[./screenshots/node-with-and-without-path.png]]

In the dashboard buffer, you'll find queries:

[[./screenshots/query.png]]

Press =<TAB>= to add its contents into the current buffer's collection.

* Keybindings / Usage
** Delve
*** Navigation / The Tab Key

Use the usual nagivation commands.

=<TAB>= does the following:
 - If there is a sublist (indented nodes) below the node at point,
   hide them outline-style.
 - If the current node hides a sublist, open it.
 - If there is no sublist, and the current item is a Zettel, insert
   all backlinks and fromlinks as sublist.
 - If there is no sublist, and the current item is a query, execute
   the query and insert the results as a sublist.
 - If there is no sublist, and the current item is a a pile, insert
   the contents of the pile and remove the pile (!).

As with most commands inserting stuff, pressing =C-u= before executing
the command offers you to add that result into another collection.

*** Preview or visit the node at point

[[./screenshots/node-with-preview.png]]

| Command / Keys | Function                                                                |
|----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| o, C-return    | Visit the node at point  (its original file)                            |
| v              | Toggle display of node (long view vs. short view with only basic infos) |
| RET            | If on a node, toggle preview                                            |

The preview buffer recognizes all id links in the previewed text and
turns them into 'buttons'. Press RET or click on these buttonized
links to visit the node they are referring to. Press =i= on the links in
the preview to directly insert the node referred to after the node at
point.

*** Marking / unmarking nodes

| Command / Keys | Function                                                     |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| m              | Mark node at point and move to next one                      |
| C-u m          | Mark all nodes below current nodes, if they form a "sublist" |
| u              | Unmark node at point and move to next one                    |
| C-u u          | Unmark sublist bewlow                                        |
| U              | Unmark all items                                             |

Most functions which work with "marked nodes" also accept regions. 

*** Choosing and inserting nodes 

Per default, offer to insert a node from a given list of nodes per
completion. If =consult= is installed, all of the following commands
allow to insert multiple nodes at once. Support for other completion
packages is lacking, contributions are welcome.

| Command / Keys | Function                                                  |
|----------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| nn             | Insert new node(s)                                        |
| nt             | Insert node(s), limit selection to a specific tag or tags |
| nb             | Insert node(s) from all backlinks of that node below      |
| nf             | insert node(s) from all fromlinks of that node below      |

*** Insert nodes directly

| Command / Keys | Function                                                                |
|----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tab            | If current node is not hiding a sublist, insert backlinks and fromlinks |
| f, C-right     | Insert fromlinks of current node as a sublist                           |
| b, C-left      | Insert backlinks to current node as a sublist                           |

*** Deleting nodes

| Command / Keys | Function                             |
|----------------+--------------------------------------|
| <delete>       | Delete marked nodes or node at point |

*** Copy and Paste

There is a rudimentary support of copy/paste. Use the usual commands
to copy the items within the active region into the kill ring, such as
=M-w=, or to copy and kill them (=C-w=). A string representing the
selected items is pushed onto the kill ring. The =yank= command (=M-y=) is
remapped to an internal function which interprets this string data and
inserts it at point.

There is currently no replacement for =yank-pop=.

*** Refresh / Update

| Command / Keys | Function                                           |
|----------------+----------------------------------------------------|
| g              | Update all nodes marked as "out of sync" (with a star) |
| C-u g          | Force update of marked nodes or node at point |

*** Piling Zettel

Like on any good real desktop, you can pile the Zettels:

| Command / Keys | Function                                        |
|----------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| m, u           | Mark or unmark first the nodes you want to pils |
| p              | Then create a pile                              |
| i              | Insert contents of pile and remove the pile     |

If you press =p= while the region is active, pile the nodes in that
region.

To insert a pile, either press =<TAB>= or =i=.

*** Insert headings
Use =h= to insert a heading. A heading is just a simple text item which
you can use to internally structure your nodes.
*** Remote Editing of Org Roam Nodes 

| Command / Keys | Function               |
|----------------+------------------------|
| +              | Add tag(s) remotely    |
| -              | Remove tag(s) remotely |

Remote editing either applies to all marked nodes and the nodes in the
currently active region, or, if nothing is marked, to the node at
point.

If editing multiple nodes, you can choose between all tags which are
present in all nodes (union of sets). Attempts to remove a tag in a node
which does not have this tag are silently skipped.

Press =g= to refresh after editing.

*** Sorting
The key =s= gives access to some sorting commands, which are presented
as a transient menu. Sorting (or reversing) applies to the current
sublist at point. If there is no sublist, the whole list is sorted.

** Delve Minor Mode

If you enable the =delve-global-minor-mode=, a =delve-minor-mode= will be
locally enabled when visting an Org Roam file. This binds some keys
which facilitate 'collecting' stuff. All keys are on a transient prefix 
which defaults to =M-n=. You can change the binding for this transient
by setting the variable =delve-minor-mode-prefix-key= manually (or using
customize).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; set this /before/ loading Delve!, e.g. in the :init section of a
  ;; use-package declaration:
    (setq delve-minor-mode-prefix-key (kbd "C-c d"))
#+end_src

*** Collecting vs. Inspecting

=Delve= offers two distinct ways of collecting nodes, corresponding to
different workflows. 

One variant is that you collect nodes while browsing through your note
files, that is, you visit =Org Roam= files and think 'Yes, that's
interesting, I will use it later!' You want to copy this node into a
list and then move on looking through your notes. For this, =Delve
Minor Mode= commands which have the word =collect= in their function name
are your friends. Per default, they add the nodes to the =last selected
Delve buffer= in the background, not disturbing your evaluation of th
nodes. 

For these collecting commands, use prefix key (usually =C-u=) to
finetune the selection of the target =Delve= buffer. If you call the
command with /no/ prefix key (the default), =Delve= will use the last
selected buffer or ask you to select one if there is none yet (e.g. by
selecting a collection stored into a file). Using /one/ prefix (=C-u=)
will unconditionally prompt you to select the target collection. Using
/two/ prefixes (=C-u C-u=) will create a new buffer for you. Note that in
this case, since you do not explicitly select these automatically
generated buffer, it will not be recognized as the "last selected
buffer" for the following operations.

The second variant is that you want to collect nodes in order to
explore their relations to other nodes within a =Delve= buffer. That is,
you encounter an interesting node and think: 'Hey, I want to look at
this node's backlinks, and their backlinks, and just generally check
where this node leads me too!' In this case, you want to switch
immediately to the buffer in which you have just collected the nodes.
Functions offering this kind of functionality have the word =inspect= in
their function name. They add the nodes to an =automatically created
Delve buffer= and then switch to it. Additionally, this buffer is
marked as the "last selected buffer" so that all collection commands
recognize it.

*** Minor Mode Keys

`M-n' opens a transient offering the user to either edit, inspect or
collect the node at point. The functions finally reached through the
transients can easily be bound separately. Have a look at how the
transients are defined or post an issue.

For editing the node at point:

| Command / Keys | Function                                                     |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| M-n e.         | Create ID link for the current heading                       |
| M-n e+         | Add tag to the heading at point                              |
| M-n e-         | Remove tag from the heading at point                         |

For collecting the node at point:

| Command / Keys | Function                                                     |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| M-n cn         | Add node at point to a Delve collection                      |
| M-n ca         | Add all nodes of current Org Roam file to a Delve collection |
| M-n cb         | Collect backlinks from current node                          |
| M-n cf         | Find the node at point in currently open Delve buffers       |

For inspecting:

| Command / Keys | Function                                                     |
|----------------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| M-n in         | Add node to an automatically created collection and open it  |
| M-n ia         | Inspect all nodes of the current Org Roam file               |
| M-n ib         | Inspect backlinks                                            |


It is planned to enable the collection keys also in =Org Roam Mode=
buffers (TODO).

* Customizations

: delve-dashboard-tags 

List of strings (or of lists of strings), from which the initial
Dashboard queries are built. E.g., with the setting =(setq
delve-dashboard-tags '("relevant"))=; the Dashboard will have a query
for all Delve nodes tagged with the tag =relevant=.

* Upcoming 

This is a list of stuff I intend to add (soonish):

 - +Save all stores with suffix '.delve'.+
 - +Do not restrict storage to one directory; use list of directories instead.+
 - +Remote editing on all marked lists.+
 - Make minor mode collection functions also work in org roam mode buffer.
 - +Add 'modified' flag and show it in the header.+
 - Add sorting according to title and mtime.

* Changelog

** 0.9.4 

  - Bookmarks. 
  - Lift storage system restriction to one predefined directory; force
    all storage files to end in =.delve=.
  - Toggle between extended view (default) and a shorter one.
  - Rudimentary copy/paste.
  - Yank copied or pasted Org Roam Node zettel into org buffers.
  - Bugfix because org-roam somwhere lost the function =org-roam-node-find-file-noselect=.
  - Sorting.

** 0.9.3

 - Refactor collecting nodes from outside Delve.
 - For non-file nodes, display the outline path. Depends now on Org
   Roam with DB 18 (merged in Nov., 10th, 21).
 - Introduce new item type "Heading" (key =h=)
 - Allow remote editing (add, remove tags) of multiple items.
 - Mark list as "modified" if items are deleted, inserted or updated.
   Storing the list removes that flag.
 - Somewhere in between is 0.9.2, I forgot to update all version
   numbers in all files. 

** 0.9 
Complete rewrite; now based on Org Roam =v2=.
